# To-Do App with React.js

This is a simple To-Do app built using React.js. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app demonstrates how to use React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to manage state and perform side effects.

## Features

- **Add a new task**: Add tasks to the list by typing in the input box and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark as completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking the "Done" button.
- **Delete a task**: Remove tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Filter tasks**: Use tabs to filter tasks by their status: **All**, **Completed**, and **Open**.
